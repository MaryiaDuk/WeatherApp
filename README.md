MVP Clean Architecture
==

a) This project was made according to Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture.

The code was developed in Android Studio, v.2.2. Make sure that your gradle version is 2.14.1 and that you have all the APIs from 16 to 25 installed.

You should select "Open another Android Studio project" from Android Studio's main screen. If the import is successful, you should
be able to run the project by selecting "Run" from the top bar.

b) A couple of improvements for the project:

- There can be a search bar for the user to get the forecasts for multiple cities, not just one
- The user should be able to switch from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice-versa (so the app doesn't use Kelvin)
- A weather widget would be helpful; the widget will get new weather info once per hour
- The possibility to compare the weather between 2 cities
- Add tests
